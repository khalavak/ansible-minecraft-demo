# file: deploy.yml
# This playbook deploys the systems and applications in the environment.
# For continuous, regular updates to the systems and applications use
# the deploy.yml playbook!
#
# The difference between provisioning and deployment is that provisioning 
# is done once, deployment is done every time you need to push something
# to production or staging
